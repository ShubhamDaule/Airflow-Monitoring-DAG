# Airflow Monitoring DAG
This code represents a liveness prober DAG designed to monitor the health of the composer.googleapis.com/environment. It is written in Python and utilizes the Airflow framework.

## Prerequisites
* An Airflow environment properly set up and running.
* Basic knowledge of Airflow concepts and configuration.

## Installation
* Clone the repository or download the code files.
* Ensure that Airflow is installed and configured with the necessary dependencies.
* Deploy the code to your Airflow instance, ensuring that the file structure is maintained.

## Usage
* Make sure that your Airflow environment is properly set up and running.
* The code defines a DAG named 'airflow_monitoring'. You can change the DAG name if desired.
* The DAG is scheduled to run every 20 minutes ('*/20 * * * *') as specified by the schedule_interval parameter. Modify this parameter according to your monitoring requirements.
* The start_date parameter is set to the current date, and the DAG has catchup set to False, which means it will only execute tasks starting from the start_date and will not run missed or backfill tasks.
* The DAG consists of a single task, t1, which is a BashOperator executing the command 'echo test'.
* Customize the command in the bash_command parameter of the BashOperator to perform the desired monitoring action.
* Adjust the retries, retry_delay, max_active_runs, and dagrun_timeout parameters in the default_args dictionary based on your requirements.

## Notes
* This code serves as a starting point for implementing a liveness monitoring DAG using Airflow. Modify it according to your specific monitoring needs.
* For more advanced monitoring scenarios, you may want to explore other Airflow operators and sensors that better suit your use case.
* Please customize the code according to your specific setup and requirements before executing it.
